# A synthwave scene with Three.js & React.
 I made this because I wanted to learn more about Three.js & React. And I quite like 3D stuff, and the aesthetic.

UPDATE (8/22/2023): This is the "new" version. The "old" version made only with HTML/JS can be found [here](https://github.com/jdichh/synthwave-scene).
